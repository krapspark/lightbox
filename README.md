Lightbox problem submission

Click on an animal button to display first 10 results from my personal Google search engine which indexes NY times and Animal Planet.
The request result is cached so subsequent display of the same animal do not create extra XHRs.

The thumbnail click events are handled by a single event listener using event delegation.

There are still I would like to add like accessibility and keyboard shortcuts before it really went to production but I felt that this was a sufficient showcase of my UI engineering abilities.
